#this was a course project of continum mechanics
# a big code from solidmechanics.org was modifed to make it compatable for cubic symmetry. 
# only three constant are necessary to define a cubic symmetry. ( total 81 elements of the material stifness matrix
#eule bunge conventin rotation matrix was used to create transformatin matrix. 
# the code was validate with known euler bunge angle
